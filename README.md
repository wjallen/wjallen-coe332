### COE 332 Homework Example Repo

Everyone should have a repository just for their COE 332 homeworks. The top
repository should be called something like "username-coe332". Within, create 
separate subfolders for each homework called "homework01", "homework02", etc.

Please push your homeworks into the appropriate folder by the due date / time.
The instructurs will clone your repo on the due date / time for evaluation.

The directory structure should look something like:

```bash
username-coe332/
├── homework01
│   └── files
├── homework02
│   ├── files
│   └── folders
├── homework03
│   └── etc
└── etc
```
